# parsers

### This repo contains a couple of parsers used heavily during my time at Namely.

#### 834 Parser
##### Uploaded v2 of my parser. It takes a raw, confusing, unreadable 834 HIPAA file and outputs a readable .csv that makes sense to clients.

#### Discovery Parser
##### The Discovery file that this parsed contained a large amount of client info on one file. For security purposes, we needed a way to provide clients parsed files without exposing other clients' information. This parser forces validation and returns a readable .csv
